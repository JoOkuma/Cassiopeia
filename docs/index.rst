========================

Cassiopeia [Jones20]_ is a package for end-to-end phylogenetic reconstruction of single-cell lineage tracing data. The package is composed of three indepdent modules:

* ``preprocess`` for processing sequencing Fastq data to character matrices
* ``solver`` for performing tree inference
* ``analysis`` for post-tree inference analysis

If you find a model useful for your research, please consider citing Cassiopeia.
