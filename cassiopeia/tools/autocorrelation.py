    """Computes Moran's I statistic.

    Using the cross-correlation between leaves as specified on the tree, compute
    the Moran's I statistic for each fo the data items specified. This will
    only work for numerical data, and will thrown an error otherwise.

    Generally, this statistic takes in a weight matrix (which can be computed
    directly from a phylogenetic tree) and a set of numerical observations that
    are centered and standardized (i.e., mean 0 and population standard deviation
    of 1). Then, the Moran's I statistic is:

    I = X' * Wn * X

    where X' denotes a tranpose, * denotes the matrix multiplier, and Wn is the
    normalized weight matrix such that sum([w_i,j for all i,j]) = 1. 

    Inspired from the tools and code used in Chaligne et al, Nature Genetics
    2021.

    The mathematical details of the statistic can be found in:
        Wartenberg, "Multivariate Spatial Correlation: A Method for Exploratory
        Geographical Analysis", Geographical Analysis (1985)

    Args:
        tree: CassiopeiaTree
        meta_columns: Columns in the Cassiopeia Tree :attr:cell_meta object
            for which to compute autocorrelations
        X: Extra data matrix for computing autocorrelations.
        W: Phylogenetic weight matrix. If this is not specified, then the
            weight matrix will be computed within the function.
        inverse_weight_fn: Inverse function to apply to the weights, if the
            weight matrix must be computed.

    Returns:
