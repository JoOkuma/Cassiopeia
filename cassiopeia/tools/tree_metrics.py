    Calculates the number of mutations that have occurred on a tree.

    Calculates the parsimony, defined as the number of character/state

    edge if a state is present at a character at the child node and this

    Calculates the log likelihood of a tree given the states at a given
    character in the leaves using Felsenstein's Pruning Algorithm, which sets
    up a recursive relation between the likelihoods of states at nodes for this
    character. The likelihood L(s, n) at a given state s at a given node n is:

    L(s, n) = Π_{n'}(Σ_{s'}(P(s'|s) * L(s', n')))

    for all n' that are children of n, and s' in the state space, with
    P(s'|s) being the transition probability from s to s'. That is,
    the likelihood at a given state at a given node is the product of
    the likelihoods of the states at this character at the children scaled by
    the probability of the current state transitioning to those states. This
    includes the missing state, as specified by `tree.missing_state_indicator`.

    We assume here that mutations are irreversible. Once a character mutates to
    a certain state that character cannot mutate again, with the exception of
    the fact that any non-missing state can mutate to a missing state.
    `mutation_probability_function_of_time` is expected to be a function that
    determine the probability of a mutation occuring given an amount of time.
    To determine the probability of acquiring a given (non-missing) state once
    a mutation occurs, the priors of the tree are used. Likewise,
    `missing_probability_function_of_time` determines the the probability of a
    missing data event occuring given an amount of time.

    The user can choose to use the character states annotated at internal
    nodes. If these are not used, then the likelihood is marginalized over
    all possible internal state characters. If the actual internal states
    are not provided, then the root is assumed to have the unmutated state
    at each character. Additionally, it is assumed that there is a single
    branch leading from the root that represents the roots' lifetime. If
    this branch does not exist and `use_internal_character_states` is set
    to False, then this branch is added with branch length equal to the
    average branch length of this tree.

    Calculates the log likelihood of a tree under a discrete process.

    A wrapper function for `get_lineage_tracing_parameters` and
    `log_likelihood_of_character` under a discrete model of lineage tracing.

    This function acquires the mutation rate, the heritable missing rate, and
    the stochastic missing probability from the tree using
    `get_lineage_tracing_parameters`. The rates are assumed to be per-generation
    rates. Then, it calculates the log likelihood for each character using
    `log_likelihood_of_character`, and then by assumption that characters
    mutate independently, sums their likelihoods to get the likelihood for the
    tree.

    Here, branch lengths are not to be used. We assume that rates are
    per-generation, that is, these rates represent the probability a mutation
    occurs on a branch regardless of the branch length t.

    Args:
        tree: The tree on which to calculate likelihood over
        use_internal_character_states: Indicates if internal node
            character states should be assumed to be specified exactly
        layer: Layer to use for the character matrix in estimating parameters.
            If this is None, then the current `character_matrix` variable will
            be used.

    Returns:
        The log likelihood of the tree given the observed character states.

    Raises:
        CassiopeiaError if the parameters consumed from the tree are invalid,
            if the tree priors are not populated, or if character states
            annotations are missing at a node.

    This function acquires the mutation rate, the heritable missing rate, and
