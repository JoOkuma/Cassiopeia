        """Simulates trees from a general birth/death process with fitness.

        The birth/death process is simulated by maintaining a list of living
        lineages and updating them with birth and death events. At each
        currently extant node in the tree representing a division event, 
        the lifespan of two potential descendants is simulated. For each 
        descendant, waiting times are sampled from the birth and death 
        distributions, and the smaller time is used to represent the next 
        event. If a death occurs, no child is added to the tree. If a birth 
        event is sampled, then the lineage is assumed to have survived long 
        enough to divide and a new internal node representing a division event
        is added, with the edge weight representing how long this node lived 
        before dividing. If no death waiting time distribution is provided, 
        the process reduces to a Yule birth process.

        Fitness is represented by each lineage maintaining its own birth scale
        parameter. This parameter determines the shape of the distribution
        from which birth waiting times are sampled and thus affects how
        quickly cells divide. At each division event, the fitness is updated
        by sampling from a distribution determining the number of mutations,
        and the multiplicative strength of each mutation is determined by
        another distribution. The birth scale parameter of the lineage is
        then updated by the total multiplicative strength factor across all
        mutations and passed on to the descendant nodes.

        There are two stopping conditions for the simulation. The first is
        "number of extant nodes", which specifies the simulation to stop the
        first moment the specified number of extant nodes exist. The second is
        "experiment time", which specifies the time at which to end the
        experiment, i.e. the experiment ends when all living lineages reach
        this time in their total lived time. At least one of these two stopping
        criteria must be provided.
